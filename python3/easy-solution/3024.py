3024. Type of Triangle
    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size 3 which can form the sides of a triangle.

    A triangle is called equilateral if it has all sides of equal length.
    A triangle is called isosceles if it has exactly two sides of equal length.
    A triangle is called scalene if all its sides are of different lengths.
    Return a string representing the type of triangle that can be formed or "none" if it cannot form a triangle.

    Example :
    Input: nums = [3,3,3]
    Output: "equilateral"
    Explanation: Since all the sides are of equal length, therefore, it will form an equilateral triangle.
