2000. Reverse Prefix of Word
    Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
    For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
    Return the resulting string.

    Example :
    Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
    Output: "dcbaefd"
    Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
    Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
