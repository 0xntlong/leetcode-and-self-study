3643. Flip Square Submatrix Vertically
    You are given an m x n integer matrix grid, and three integers x, y, and k.
    The integers x and y represent the row and column indices of the top-left corner of a square submatrix and the integer k represents the size (side length) of the square submatrix.
    Your task is to flip the submatrix by reversing the order of its rows vertically.
    Return the updated matrix.

    Example :
    Input: grid = [[1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8],[9,10,11,12],[13,14,15,16]], x = 1, y = 0, k = 3
    Output: [[1,2,3,4],[13,14,15,8],[9,10,11,12],[5,6,7,16]]
    Explanation:
    The diagram above shows the grid before and after the transformation.
