1975. Maximum Matrix Sum
    You are given an n x n integer matrix. You can do the following operation any number of times:
    Choose any two adjacent elements of matrix and multiply each of them by -1.
    Two elements are considered adjacent if and only if they share a border.
    Your goal is to maximize the summation of the matrix's elements. Return the maximum sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above.

    Example :
    Input: matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
    - Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
    - Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.
