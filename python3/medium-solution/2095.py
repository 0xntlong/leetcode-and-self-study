2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List
    You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.
    The middle node of a linked list of size n is the ⌊n / 2⌋th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to x.
    For n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, the middle nodes are 0, 1, 1, 2, and 2, respectively.
    Example :
    Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
    Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
    Explanation:
    The above figure represents the given linked list. The indices of the nodes are written below.
    Since n = 7, node 3 with value 7 is the middle node, which is marked in red.
    We return the new list after removing this node.
