I’ve created this GitHub repository to share my personal coding journey and document my self-learning process.

And I share it on Threads platform where I share and connect with friends who have the same passion for solving algorithms and share and contribute with each other. And here is my id: leetcodedaybyday

In addition to the Daily LeetCode Challenge, I’ll also be posting other problems I practice every day as part of my effort to improve my algorithmic skills. My goal is to work through the entire LeetCode problem set, and I will keep updating this repository until I finish all the exercises.

I’ll start with the easy-level problems to build a strong foundation, and then gradually move on to the medium and hard levels.

I look forward to your interest, feedback, and contributions so that we can collaborate and discover the best and most effective solutions together. Let’s conquer LeetCode and grow step by step!
