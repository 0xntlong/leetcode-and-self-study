/**
3494. Find the Minimum Amount of Time to Brew Potions
    You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.

    In a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the ith wizard on the jth potion is timeij = skill[i] * mana[j].

    Since the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. â€‹

    Return the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.

    Example :
    Input: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]
    Output: 110
    Explanation:
    Potion Number	Start time	Wizard 0 done by	Wizard 1 done by	Wizard 2 done by	Wizard 3 done by
    0	            0	        5	                30	                40	                60
    1	            52	        53	                58	                60	                64
    2	            54	        58	                78	                86	                102
    3	            86	        88	                98	                102	                110
    As an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0th potion till time t = 60.
